hotpcli: OATH-HOTP command line tool

hotpcli reads the DER-encoded key file specified and prints out the next code,
updating the key file with the new key. 


Usage:
	hotpcli [-cnw] [-k keyfile] [-u url]
                -c              Print out an integrity check; this
                                displays a baseline key value and
                                the current counter for synchronisation.
                -k keyfile      Specify the file containing the
                		key; defaults to hotp.key.
                -n              Don't update the counter in the key
                		file.
                -u url          An OATH-HOTP URL containing the
                                key-value information to use for
                                the key.
		-w		Write the url specified with -u to the
				key file and exit.

The program automatically updates the key file with the new counter;
the -n option will allow this behaviour to be overridden. To generate
a key from a url, pass the -w and -u options; the counter will not be
updated.
