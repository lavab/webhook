hotpgen: generate new HOTP key values from the command line

Usage:

	hotpgen [-d digits] [-p password] [-r] [label]
                -d digits       Specify the number of digits to
                		use, typically 6 or 8; defaults
				to 6.

		-r		Randomise the initial counter;
				defaults to false as this is
				not supported by all clients.

		label		An optional label for the key;
				for example, an email address
				or username.

The program will dump out three files; a PNG image, a text file,
and a DER-encoded key file that can be used with hotpcli.  The text
file contains the URL encoded in the QR code; the QR code may be
displayed to users to scan into their mobile apps. If a label is
provided, the files are named by the label (e.g. label.png and
label.txt); otherwise, the files are named as the base32-encoded
URL.
